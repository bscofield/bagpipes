Bagpipes
========

Bagpipes is a resourceful plugin, meaning that it provides a bundled set of resources (ala REST) for a Rails application. In particular, installing Bagpipes gives you access to the resources required for basic forum functionsâ€”topics, messages, and members.

At present, the member management functionality is not present. Members can be added from the console like this:
  
  > u = User.find(1)
  > u.create_member :name => "Name", :administrator => true
  
Only administrators can create topics, and only members can create messages. Anyone can view the forum, however.

Like any resourceful plugin, this should be easily customizable for your specific needs.

Example
=======

  rake bagpipes:install


Integration
===========
You'll need some sort of authentication scheme that provides the following hooks in the controller:
  logged_in?
  current_user

The easiest way to take care of this is to install the restful authentication plugin.

You'll also need to define a new association in your user (or account or whatever) model, by adding this line:

has_one :member, :as => :user, :dependent => :destroy
